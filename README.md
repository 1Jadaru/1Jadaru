# Hey, I'm James 👋

Founder of [Jadaru](https://jadaru.co) — a product studio building useful tools with AI-powered development.

## What I'm Building

🏠 **[AmCalc](https://amcalc.com)** — Free state-specific mortgage calculators. Compare rates, model refinance scenarios, and see how extra payments accelerate your payoff. Built for real homebuyers, not lead gen.

📊 **[HomeTrackers](https://hometrackers.app)** — Home tracking and management tools for homeowners. Coming soon.

🚀 **[Jadaru.co](https://jadaru.co)** — Our ventures page where we share what we're building next, and you can tell us what problems need solving.

## How I Work

I don't write code — I orchestrate AI agents to build production software. 100% AI-developed, human-directed. Every project above was built through prompt engineering, architecture decisions, and agent coordination.
